The analysis in this report suggests several measures that policy makers can take to empower women and ensure continuing progress towards gender equality. In the economic sphere: • Reduce sex-segregation in labour markets : Policy makers should review national laws restricting women’s access to certain occupations or job families. They should undertake analyses of the informal barriers to women’s participation across sectors and occupations and develop tailored strategies for overcoming them; • Employer codes of conduct : Policy makers should make the elimination of gender discrimination in the labour market a policy priority and encourage business and trade associations, and their members, to adopt codes of conduct to promote gender equality, including measures to tackle discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace, improving access to child care and other services, and providing support for women to build successful careers; • Professional mentorship : Policy makers should support initiatives to increase opportunities for mentorship for women in business and male-dominated sectors; • Gender-sensitive agricultural policies : Policy makers should recognise the critical role played by women as food producers, and factor this into national agricultural and food security policies and strategies and/or their implementation. A concerted effort to improve women farmers’ access to essential inputs, including land, technology, extension services and finance, can help build resilience in the face of growing climate pressures; and • Tackling time poverty : Policy makers should press ahead with expanding access to basic infrastructure services, particularly clean water and energy, to reduce women’s time poverty and provide more time for employment and livelihood activities. In the social sphere: • Supporting out-of-school girls : Policy makers should develop programmes to support young women who dropped out of school because of COVID-19 or other pressures to return to the education system. This should include tailored support for young mothers; • Improving menstrual hygiene : Policy makers should increase their investment in menstrual hygiene and associated awareness raising in schools, to tackle a common cause of girls dropping out of school; • Closing the literacy gap : Policy makers should fund programmes to close the remaining gender gap in literacy and numeracy, to help women enter and succeed in the workforce; • Bridging the skills gap : Policy makers should intensify their efforts to improve young women’s access to scientific and technical education, vocational training and opportunities to build skills in business and entrepreneurship, including digital skills; • Investigating the barriers to boys’ education : Policy makers should recognise that there are also gender-specific barriers to boys’ education. They should commission more data collection and analysis to inform potential policy responses; • Strengthening reproductive health and rights : Policy makers should develop programmes to improve adolescent girls’ awareness of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases and improve their education about and access to contraceptives; • Improving maternal health : Policy makers should intensify their efforts to reduce unacceptably high levels of maternal mortality, including by improving the quality of primary health care and the availability of clean water and sanitation in primary health centres; • Promoting clean cooking : Policy makers should recognise indoor air pollution as a major threat to the health of African women and girls and promote access to affordable clean cooking solutions; and • Reducing gender-based violence against women : Ensure that shelters and other essential services for survivors of gender-based violence are prioritised in national budgets. On voice and representation : • Quotas in parliament and government : African countries should consider introducing quotas to strengthen women’s participation in politics and government. Ideally, a system of quotas would encompass all levels of government and senior administrative roles. Where quotas are already in place, they should be reviewed regularly to identify opportunities to improve their enforcement and ensure they lead to meaningful participation; • Support for women politicians : African countries should explore options for supporting aspiring female politicians, helping them to campaign, develop policy-making skills, and build support networks; • Gender in debt management : Policy makers in countries facing debt pressure should ensure that fiscal constraints do not lead to cuts in services that are essential to women, particularly women’s health and reproductive services and protection from domestic violence. Fiscal measures should, therefore, be designed with a gender lens, in consultation with women; • Women, Peace and Security : Given the alarming rise of conflict and insecurity across Africa, African countries should intensify their engagement with the UN Security Council’s Women, Peace and Security agenda, developing and implementing national action plans to protect women in times of conflict and to increase their participation in conflict prevention and peacebuilding; • Shocks and crises : When planning national policy responses to the shocks and crises facing Africa today, including health threats, food insecurity and climate change, African countries should ensure that women are engaged at every stage, to help mitigate the effects on women and to facilitate their contribution to building national resilience; and • Data on gender equality : Given continuing gaps in national data on gender equality, and the growing threat to women posed by the shocks and crises facing Africa today, African countries should review their national statistical institutes from a gender lens, to identify hidden biases and to improve the generation of data, including on the gendered impacts of shocks and crises.
