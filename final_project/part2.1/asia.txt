With respect to achievements in implementation of the Platform for Action, countries in Asia and the Pacific identified common successes and documented particular areas in which gains have been made in some of the ESCAP subregions.
Three categories of achievement were identified by countries from all five of the SCAP subregions: (a) strengthening gender equality in national governments and governance; (b) addressing violence against women and girls, and (c) promoting the leadership and political participation of women. In terms of institutional frameworks for achieving
gender equality, the Beijing+20 respondent countries highlighted (a) the adoption of gender equality-related policies, legislation, action plans and strategies,18 along with accession to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; (b) the establishment and/or strengthened status and mandates of national women’s machineries;19 (c) the increase in awareness of and commitment to gender equality across government entities, and (d) the expansion of gender mainstreaming across the government sector, including the introduction of gender-responsive budgeting. 
Concerning violence against women and girls,20 the Beijing+20 respondent countries from the five ESCAP subregions highlighted the introduction of legislation; strengthened law enforcement capacity; establishment of government entities tasked to address the elimination of violence against women and girls; prevention programmes;
awareness-raising and mobilization of communities; and implementation of targeted campaigns, addressing such issues as human trafficking and sorcery.
With respect to the third regionally-shared achievement — being greater political participation and leadership by women21 — the Beijing+20 respondent countries reported that women have occupied, and continue to occupy, senior government and non-government positions, from heads of government and Supreme Court judges to serving on national boards, special taskforces and peace negotiating bodies. The Beijing+20 respondent 
countries also noted the positive impacts of special temporary measures, such as quotas, in increasing the representation of women amongst political party candidates and parliamentarians. 
At the subregional levels, 2014 Beijing+20 countries in the Pacific, in East and North-East Asia, in South-East Asia and in South and South-West Asia identified
achievements in women’s economic empowerment; achievements related to (a) the revision of legislation; (b) the introduction of flexible working arrangements; (c) the delineation of minimum wages, (d) the provision of childcare services, and (e) women’s
greater access to financial services, including credit.
Successes in the area of education were emphasized by Beijing+20 respondent countries from both South-East Asia and South and South-West Asia, with such observations as increased female literacy levels; improved school performance amongst girls; greater
numbers of women continuing to tertiary education; gender parity in primary school enrolments and girls increasingly studying traditionally male-dominated subjects.
For some of the Beijing+20 countries located in the Pacific, in South-East Asia and in South and South-West Asia, achievements in relation to women’s and girls’ health, and particularly maternal health, were recorded; evidenced by, for example, the reduction in the maternal mortality ratio and the construction of maternity facilities in hospitals. The women, peace and security agenda, or issues relating to “women and conflict”, were, in turn, highlighted by Beijing+20 respondent countries in the Pacific and in North and Central Asia.
